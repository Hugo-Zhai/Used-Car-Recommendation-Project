### Project Summary

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive car price information system that offers a one-stop solution for users to access, manage, and compare price information for various car makes and models. This system will allow users to search for car prices, add new vehicle price information, and delete outdated models. Key features include an intuitive search interface, an administrative interface for data management, and an after-tax price calculator for full purchase cost estimation.

The system is designed to enhance user experience with a simple and user-friendly registration and login interface. Users can sign up by providing basic information and login to access main functions like car information search and management, and after-tax price calculation.
